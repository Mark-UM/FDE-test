# Ecommerce Order Support Assistant

Small/cross-border ecommerce support agents answer questions such as “Where is my
order?” by manually collecting facts from order systems, logistics systems, and
warehouse notes. This product will bring those facts together into traceable
evidence and help an agent prepare a careful reply.

**Current implementation: Product Phase 1 — External Integration Foundation.**
Canonical snapshots, clocks, four Provider protocols and DemoCommerce HTTP adapters
are implemented and tested against the independent S0-S1 service. This explicitly
authorized phase supersedes the original roadmap's Phase 1 database/seed ordering.
The Product API still only exposes `GET /health`; the frontend remains the Phase 0
static shell. There is no business workflow, AI, Evidence, CaseContext, authentication,
retry or cache. PostgreSQL is provisioned but the application does not connect to it.

## Core V1 target

Inquiry → Authentication / Authorization → Order lookup → All parcels / Logistics
→ Warehouse notes → Evidence → CaseContext → Structured LLM analysis → Validation
→ Human review → Mock send → Audit / Metrics.

**Program owns facts. AI owns interpretation and wording.** Backend code controls
permissions, deterministic rules, freshness, and actions. Important claims must
trace to evidence. Facts, plans, and uncertainty stay distinct; cached/old data
cannot be presented as live. External systems enter through Provider interfaces.
Human review is required before sending.

This is not a general chatbot, SaaS/Agent platform, CRM, ERP, or ecommerce platform.
Core V1 excludes autonomous support, multi-tenancy, payment, inventory forecasting,
marketing, and execution of refunds, cancellations, address changes, or compensation.

The original root-level plans were moved unchanged into `docs/plans/` using the
canonical filenames above. Historical filenames referenced inside the plans refer
to those same documents.

## Local setup

Requires Python 3.12+ and Node.js 22.13+ within Node 22, or Node 24+
(Node 22 LTS is used in CI and Docker).
Docker Compose v2 is required only for the container setup.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repository root (`cp .env.example .env` on
POSIX, `Copy-Item .env.example .env` on PowerShell). Replace the example password in
both `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `DATABASE_URL`; URL-encode special characters in the
URL password. The example contains placeholders, not deployment credentials.

**Containers:** from the repository root:

```sh
docker compose config --quiet
docker compose up --build
```

Open frontend at `http://localhost:5173` and backend health at
`http://localhost:8000/health` (API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`). Ports can be
changed in `.env`. Services bind published ports to local loopback. PostgreSQL
uses a persistent named volume and Compose hostname `postgres`. Backend and frontend
source mounts support development reload; restart/rebuild after configuration or
dependency changes. `docker compose down` stops services and preserves database data.
These are development containers, not a production deployment.

**Host processes:** change the `DATABASE_URL` hostname in `.env` to `localhost`
(and use `POSTGRES_PORT` if changed). No database is needed for Phase 0 health.
Settings read the root `.env`; process environment variables take precedence.

```sh
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
# POSIX: source .venv/bin/activate
# PowerShell: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

In a second terminal:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Host CLI ports are explicit arguments; `BACKEND_PORT` and `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env`
control Compose port publishing. The frontend currently makes no API calls.

## Checks

From `backend/`, with its virtual environment active:

```sh
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
pytest
```

From `frontend/`:

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

From the repository root, validate without a personal `.env`:

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env.example config --quiet
```

CI runs unit tests (`pytest -m "not integration"`) and the lint/build/config checks.
The independent Sandbox is not available in this repository's CI; real HTTP tests
must run separately as described below, and skipped tests do not prove integration.
`/health` returns exactly
`{"status":"ok","service":"ecommerce-order-support-backend"}`; it reports
process liveness, not database connectivity or external-system readiness.

## Sandbox integration and real HTTP tests

The boundary is `DemoCommerce HTTP JSON → Sandbox adapter → canonical Product snapshot`.
Product consumers use the protocols; raw fields and routes are confined to the
adapter. OrderProvider reads orders and lists parcels; LogisticsProvider reads one
canonical parcel's shipment/events. The caller accounts for each parcel independently.
WarehouseProvider preserves notes, and MessageProvider reads inquiries/records replies.
No Provider calls another Provider or resolves contradictory sources.

In the independent **demo-commerce-sandbox** checkout (locally a sibling directory):

```sh
uv sync --locked
# Optional: set SANDBOX_DB_PATH to a new temporary SQLite filename in your shell.
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
```

Do not reset a shared Sandbox. A fresh database is seeded automatically; tests
use unique reply keys and create three simulated replies per idempotency test run.
The Product never imports Sandbox code or reads its database. Source timestamps
are fixed relative to `2026-09-20T06:00:00Z`; integration tests use FixedClock at
that instant. Receipt `sent_at` remains source-owned actual acceptance time.

Configure `SANDBOX_BASE_URL` and positive `SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` in root `.env`
or the process environment. S0-S1 has **no API key**. For a Product container calling
a host Sandbox on Docker Desktop, change the URL to `http://host.docker.internal:9000`
and ensure the Sandbox is reachable from the container; host loopback inside the
container points to the container itself. No client is created by `/health`.

From `backend/`, with its environment active and Sandbox already running:

```sh
pytest --sandbox-url http://127.0.0.1:9000
# Only the real HTTP suite, with individual scenario results:
pytest tests/integration -v --sandbox-url http://127.0.0.1:9000
```

`INTEGRATION_SANDBOX_URL` is an alternative to the explicit flag. Without either,
the integration suite is visibly skipped; if a URL is supplied but unavailable,
tests fail rather than falling back to mocks. `SANDBOX_BASE_URL` configures runtime
clients; the separate integration opt-in prevents accidental test writes.

Adapters are used via `async with SandboxClient(Settings(), clock) as client`;
pass that client to the concrete Provider. Omit `clock` to use SystemClock. Exiting
closes HTTP connections. Only the adapter handles `/api/...` paths and source JSON.

See [contract mappings and differences](docs/external-system-contract.md) for S10's
actual logistics 404 (distinct from S01's successful empty parcels), source timestamp
ownership, typed failures, and idempotency. Fixed seed scenarios have no unknown
statuses or malformed payloads; supplemental unit tests cover those conditions.

## Limitations and next work

No support workflow or send endpoint is exposed. Provider send is a low-level
integration operation; authorization/approval will be implemented before exposure.
There is no automatic retry, cache, partial-result aggregator or freshness policy.
If events fail after shipment retrieval, the operation raises the typed failure,
rather than returning an apparently complete shipment. A parcel without tracking
cannot be queried yet and produces a local ValueError without HTTP.

SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, and a PostgreSQL driver remain deferred. HTTPX is now a
runtime dependency. Further work requires a separately authorized phase.
React Router and TanStack Query are deferred until there are workflows to route
or fetch. Frontend dependencies are locked in `package-lock.json`; Python uses
bounded dependency ranges and does not yet have a full transitive lock.
