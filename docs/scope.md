# Scope freeze

## Current delivery: Product Phase 1 — External Integration Foundation

Phase 0 foundation remains. This explicitly authorized Phase 1 supersedes the
original roadmap's database/seed phase ordering. In scope: canonical typed snapshots,
SystemClock/FixedClock, four Provider protocols, explicit external errors, HTTPX
Sandbox client and adapters, real HTTP integration tests and supporting documentation.

Out of this phase: persistent domain models, migrations, Product seed data,
authentication/authorization flows, Evidence Engine, CaseContext, AI/LLM calls,
drafting, UI changes, RAG, retries, caching, aggregation, conflict resolution,
freshness policy, Sandbox implementation or real logistics/channel integrations.
Simulated reply dispatch is tested only at the Provider boundary; no Product
approval or send endpoint is exposed.

## Future Core V1 in scope

- Order-status support consultation for a small/cross-border ecommerce team.
- Authorized order, all-parcel/logistics and warehouse information retrieval.
- Evidence-based explanation with sources, timestamps and explicit uncertainty.
- Structured analysis and reply drafts with deterministic validation.
- Human review/edit/approval and idempotent mock sending.
- Auditability, basic metrics, and tests of failures, missing/conflicting/stale data.

## Explicitly out of Core V1

- Refund execution, cancellation execution, address modification, payment or
  compensation execution. Requests are routed to manual processes, not executed.
- CRM, ERP, inventory forecasting, marketing or a complete ecommerce platform.
- Multi-tenant SaaS, general Agent platforms, generic customer-service chatbots,
  or autonomous customer service.
- Real logistics/carrier and customer-channel integrations in the baseline release.

## Separate external environment

DemoCommerce Sandbox supplies simulated external facts, support messages and
controllable failures over HTTP. It contains no AI and is not this product's
database or a second ecommerce product. Its roadmap is separate from product
phases. Its S0-S1 HTTP service now exists independently and is consumed here.

Any proposed feature must directly improve the defined order-support workflow
and be authorized for the current phase. Otherwise defer it.
